# just-post-it

just-post-it is a very basic twitter-like social network application made in django, pure javascript, HTML and CSS.

Current functionalities are: posting, liking, unliking, following and unfollowing users, viewing all posts made ever, viewing posts made by the user you follow, and editing already made posts.

More functionalities to come soon!!
